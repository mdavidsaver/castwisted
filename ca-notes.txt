Additions/Corrections to cosylab doc

http://epics.cosylab.com/cosyjava/JCA-Common/Documentation/CAproto.html

# ECA_* codes are wrong.  Not just a simple enumerations.

# Responce to read notify (0x0f) field P1 is status code and not SID.  Sec. 6.15.2

# Event cancel reply dcount also same as request.  Sec. 6.2.2

# Event data update (except for cancel confirm) can't have 0 payload.  (libca ignores message)

# Event data update with status != ECA_NORMAL has payload all zeros (pcas).
  And translated into an exception by the client (libca).
